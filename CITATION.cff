  LLM Buddy is a Computer-Aided Method Engineering (CAME) tool developed
  to address methodological challenges in conducting rigorous research with
  Large Language Models. The tool provides comprehensive prompt capture,
  unified prompt history, file association tracking, and support for the
  Conversational Forking methodology. It was developed as part of doctoral
  research at the University of South Florida and used to document 1,555
  prompts across 6 Elaborated Action Design Research (eADR) cycles, enabling
  unprecedented documentation of AI-augmented development processes.
